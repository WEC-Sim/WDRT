`WDRT` Documentation and Users Guide
====================================

Introduction
------------
The `WEC Design Response Toolbox (WDRT)` was developed by `Sandia National Laboratories <http://energy.sandia.gov/energy/renewable-energy/water-power/>`_ and the `National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) <http://www.nrel.gov/water/>`_ to provide extreme response and fatigue analysis tools, specifically for design analysis of ocean structures such as wave energy converters (WECs).

Features
--------
The `WDRT` contains a number of code modules to assist in the major processes of WEC survival design analysis:

* **environmental characterization** - metocean environmental analysis and statistics
* **shortTermExtreme**  - analysis of short-term (sea-state specific) extreme responses
* **longTermExtreme** - analysis of long-term (design life) extreme responses
* **fatigue** - fatigue analysis
* **most-likely extreme response (MLER)** - focused-wave construction for efficient high-fidelity modeling
